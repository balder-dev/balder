    This testcase executes the general CALCULATOR example.

    It has two inherited scenarios, while the parent scenario defines a connection and the child defines another
    connection. The environment uses a setup, that requires exactly one connection.

    The test validates, that only the single correct variation will be executed.
    This secures that the parent connection will NOT be inherited.
