    """
    This testcase executes an expanded version of the CALCULATOR environment.

    It defines three new features ``VDeviceHelperFeature1``, ``VDeviceHelperFeature2`` and ``VDeviceHelperFeature3``
    that are used by the ``ScenarioAdding.NumberOneDevice`` and the ``SetupPythonAdd.NumberProvider1``.
    Every of these features has a VDevice that reduces the connection tree:

    * ``VDeviceHelperFeature1``: ``SimulatedChildConnection.based_on(SimulatedParentConnection)``
    * ``VDeviceHelperFeature2``: ``SimulatedChildConnection``
    * ``VDeviceHelperFeature3``: ``MySimplySharedMemoryConnection``

    The VDevices are mapped on setup level here!

    The devices (both scenario and setup) have a connection
    ``SimulatedChildConnection.based_on(SimulatedParentConnection) AND MySimplySharedMemoryConnection``, that should
    work with the different mapped VDevice requirements of these features.

    The test should run successfully with exactly one variation (these features are only provided for one ``Number*``
    device).
