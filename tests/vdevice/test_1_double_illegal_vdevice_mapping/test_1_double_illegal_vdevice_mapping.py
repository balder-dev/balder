    This testcase executes the basic example and checks that the session terminates without errors and that the
    variation will not be executed.

    The test is the expanded version of the basic calculator example. Its feature `ProvidesANumberFeature` has two
    additional VDevice classes that are both mapped but on different levels (one is correctly mapped on scenario level
    and one on setup level). This is allowed, but leads to the not-executing of the variation.
    To map another vDevice this test devices an additional not connected scenario device `DoNothingDevice`.
