Balder is a very powerful, universal and flexible python test system that allows you to reuse a once written testcode as 
efficiently as possible for different but similar platforms/devices/applications. Balder's goal is
being a platform for combining the single steps of defining, developing and documenting the entire test 
process while using test scenarios which can be reused across different projects.

You can share your own testcode by creating a new BalderHub project, or you use an existing BalderHub project, by simply 
installing and using it. This makes the test development for your project much faster, since it is often times enough to 
only provide the user-specific code.

Be part of the progress and share your tests with others, your company or the whole world.


# Installation

You can install the latest release with pip:

```
python -m pip install baldertest
```

# Run Balder

After you've installed it, you can run Balder inside a Balder environment with the following command:

```
balder
```

You can also provide a specific path to the balder environment directory by using this console argument:

```
balder --working-dir /path/to/working/dir
```

# Contribution guidelines

Any help is appreciated. If you want to contribute to balder, take a look into the 
[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/balder-dev/balder/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Balder is still in its early steps. Unfortunately, this also means that we don't have a broad variety of BalderHub 
projects at the moment.

Are you an expert in your field? Do you enjoy the concept of balder? How about you create your own
BalderHub project? Take a look into our [Balder GitHub Group](https://github.com/balder-dev) and feel free to share 
your ideas. You can contribute to an existing project or create your own. If you are not sure, a project for your idea 
already exists or if you want to discuss your ideas with others, feel free to
[create an issue in the BalderHub main entry project](https://github.com/balder-dev/hub.balder.dev/issues) or
[start a new discussion](https://github.com/balder-dev/hub.balder.dev/discussions).
