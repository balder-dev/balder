Balder is a Python test framework that allows you to reuse test code you've written once across different platforms,
devices, or applications. You can **install ready-to-use tests** or apply your **own pre-written tests** to evaluate
all kinds of end-user devices/applications - without reinventing the wheel.

           Write a single test scenario for your core business logic, and reuse it across the web, mobile apps,
           desktop applications, or even embedded devices.

           features that change in the product.

To get a short introduction to how Balder works, take a look at the :ref:`Getting Started <Getting Started>` section.
It provides a brief overview of the theory behind the Balder test system. You'll find a detailed explanation of all
components in the :ref:`Basic Guides <Basic Guides>`.

The different subsections of :ref:`Basic Guides <Basic Guides>` and :ref:`Reference Guides <Reference Guides>` are
written independently of each other. So feel free to jump to any subsection you want to learn more about. However, we
always recommend starting with the complete :ref:`Getting Started <Getting Started>` section before diving deeper into
the :ref:`Basic Guides <Basic Guides>` and :ref:`Reference Guides <Reference Guides>`.
